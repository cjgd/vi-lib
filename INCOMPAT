Some incompatibilities found on most popular vi clones available. 

versions: 
	nvi 1.79 
	vim, 4.5
	elvis, 2.0

.............

:.g/foo/ex_cmds

	where foo DOES NOT exist on current line

	. nvi, elvis: don't do subsequent cmds, and don't complain either
	. vim: don't do cmds, but DOES complain (and make macro stop)

:.v/foo/ex_cmds

	where foo DOES exist, actually works (i.e. don't do cmds and don't 
	complain) for all of them

as of vim 4.6, this seems to be fixed.

.............

ma cmds `a

	. nvi, vim: honors the marked column, i.e. always move back 
	  to the same column marked

	. elvis: honors marked character, i.e. it moves back to the 
	  same char, which might be shifted right or left meanwhile

.............

lineA
lineB

:j! apllied anywhere on lineA

	- vim: place cursor on the first char of "lineA"
	- nvi: place cursor on last char of "lineA"
	- elvis: cursor on first char of "lineB"

lineAlineB
^		vim
    ^		nvi
     ^		elvis

	elvis seems to be doing the right thing

.............

<some text changing command> yy .

vim, elvis: at '.' redo 'some text changing command'
nvi: at '.' do nothing (perhaps it is repeating the yy)

.............

fire up vi, with no file, then `:r some_file' --
	
	vi
	:r some_file


	. vim, elvis: keep "no current file", and report it when saving
	. nvi: adopts `some_file' as its new current file name, and tries
	  to save on it, at exit

.............

when editing an empty file, read into some file `x'

	. nvi, elvis: first line of `x' goes into first line of buffer
	. vim: first line of `x' goes into second line of buffer -- 
	  it lefts one blank at start
