vi-lib is a collection of vi macros. 

most vi macros, may even be obsolete, but show how to do some tedious
tasks, using only vi and nothing else.

--

all files contains vi macros, or abbreviations [or something] that
should be directly used by most vi clones.

some are specific, for instance, the `complete' file, contains a alt-tab
macro, that does sequential search and completion on current word,
unfortunately, it only works with nvi quoting mechanism.
