"		these work fine for Elvis, 1.8pl13
"		but nvi.1.34 after deleting something, forgets
"		the contents of the unamed buffer, even
"		if we are deleting to a particulary buffer
"
"		so, small changes are needed, just in q1 macro
"
"		----
"
" 	ql 	insert q1 after every char, except last, on which 
"		it appends q2
"
"		do setup, i.e. create next line, on which the reversed
"		line shall stay
"
"	q1	do the swapping
"
"	q2	cleanup
"
" note that the ^V (the 4th char counting from the end) can be ommited
" it is just there to prevent the call of my macro ^[k !!
"
map ql :s/^/#/:s/./&q1/g$r2okq1
"map q1 0x"x2xj0Pk@x
map q1 0"yx"x2xj0"yPk@x
map q2 dd:s/#$//
"
"	qa	an hack to reverse all lines of the file
"
"		still uses q1
"		q2 is replaced by q3 that is the command to next line
"		q4 is the command for last line
"
map qa :%s/^/#/:%s/./&q1/g:%s/.$/3/:$s/.$/4/:%s/$//1Gq1

map q4 :v/./d:%s/.$//

"
"
"	qd	for measuring time taken to do the job
"		now, this will reverse all lines as above,
"		but add two lines to the beg of the file, 
"		the first is the output of the date command 
"		before the thing started, the second, is the date after
"
"	q5	clean up and the date after QD
"

map q5 :2,$v/./d:2,$s/.$//1G:r! dateq6
"
"	for these next two: 
"
"		use the first one for getting two lines with date command
"		the other for getting just one line with the number of 
"		elapsed time in seconds
"
"
"	uncomment for getting the two lines (just a fake macro)
"map q6 $
"
"	uncomment this, for getting the elapsed time in seconds
