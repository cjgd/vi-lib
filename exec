" 	_X	execute current line as VI commands
" 	_E	execute current line as EX commands
" 	_T	read characters to next line (opened)
"
" notes: 
" 	the _X and _E don't delete the line that gets exec'ed
" 	to actually do that, replace `"xyy' by `"xdd' on _X and 
" 		`y x' by `d x' on _E... 
" 
" 	this macros are very handy,
" 		_X serves to test and apply a semi complex task
" 		_E idem, but also to load mappings in .exrc format
" 			directly from the line, i.e. no need to 
" 			escape all line EXCEPT one that contains 
" 			the macro, and source %
" 		_T good for doing interaction with user, from inside
" 			alias, ex: 
" 
" 			map g iInsert your name: _TIYour name is 
" 
" 
"
map _X mx"xyy@x`x
map _E :kx|y x|@x|'x
map _T :r!cat /dev/tty
