"	Usage: _FF on a sequence of lines ended by an empty one
"
"	_FF	format current paragraph
"		join all lines of it and use _FG on them
"
"	_FG	split current line (which may be very long)
"		into severals of aprx same size

"	_FT	even cleaner... 
"		self protects itself, creating an empty line at end
"		and remove it when exit
"		also, don't create very BIG lines (unlike _FF)
"		and don't depend on .v/./ and .g/./ behavior (unlike _FM)
"		complex but good :) 
"		use a,b,c,d,e,f,g buffers
"		_FT: program 4 fixed buffers (c,a,b,f,g)
"		a: buffer to exec on short lines (<=76)
"		b: to exec on big lines (>76)
"		c: main p
"		d: used at runtime by @c to exec @a or @b
"		e: used at runtime by @a to exec @f or @g
"		f: exec on lines, which are followed by a non empty line
"		g: exec on lines, which are followed by an empty line (cleanup)
