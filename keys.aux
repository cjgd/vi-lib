" example: a file has
" "map! up new..		<- marked line
" "map! down new..
" "map! left new..
" "map! right new..
" 
" and on the LAST 4 lines has
" 
" map! up old..
" map! down old..
" map! left old..
" map! right old..
" 
" apllying g on marked line, the last lines would be now
" 
" map! up new..
" map! down new..
" map! left new..
" map! right new..
